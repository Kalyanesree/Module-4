# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## Program
```
list1=[5, 10, 20]

try:
    print(list1[5])
except IndexError:
   print("You're out of list range")
```
## Output
<img width="1127" height="155" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3ad6cd1-cac5-4a8a-9114-d74834be0cf8" />

## Result
  Thus, the Python program that handles an **IndexError** is executed successfully.
